/**
 * aSysBus hook function example
 * 
 * This example shows how to link a function to a set of metadata. This is especially
 * useful if you want to implement your own actors. Here we also use two interfaces,
 * namely a CAN-bus and UART which both can be used to send or receive packets. The
 * node will route incoming packets to the other interface.
