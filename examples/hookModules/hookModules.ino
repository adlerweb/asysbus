/**
 * aSysBus hook module example
 * 
 * There are several modules to handle generic functions. This example uses two 
 * modules designed to handle the pins of an Arduino as inputs or outputs 
 * respectively.
 * When using modules their configuration is stored in EEPROM which itself will
 * get initialized on first boot. Later you can use bus messages to change the 
 * EEPROM and as such reconfigure the node remotely.
